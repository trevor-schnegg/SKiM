# SKiM
SKiM (Short K-mers in Metagenomics) is a metagenomic classifier implemented in Rust. SKiM was originally designed for the classification of ONT reads, particularly during an adaptive sampling experiment. However, there is no reason to believe it would not work for other sequencing technologies and contexts.
