# SKiM
SKiM (Short K-mers in Metagenomics) is a metagenomic classifier implemented in Rust. The key feature of SKiM is that it uses short $k$-mers ($k=15$ or $k16$) to perform classification. Short $k$-mers, in combination with data compression techniques and statistical correction, allow SKiM to perform fast and accurate metagenomic classification over large collections of assemblies with a very small memory footprint. Originally, SKiM was designed for classifcation of ONT reads (paticularly during adaptive sampling), where the relatively high error rate of sequencing is likely to impact long $k$-mers more than short ones. However, there is no reason to believe that SKiM would not work under other contexts.
